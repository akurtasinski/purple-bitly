purple-bitly -- Bit.ly Short URL Plugin for libpurple/Pidgin
by John Bellone <jb@thunkbrightly>

COMPILATION

	To compile this bad boy from scratch you are going to need a couple
of libraries that are freely available. The first, which is probably the most
obvious, is a copy of an up-to-date Pidgin source tree. You will not need to
replace your installation of Pidgin, but you do need the source in order to
compile cleanly. 

	http://www.pidgin.im/

	The second dependency is libcurl, which is avaiable on most Linux
installations already, but may not be for other platforms. This library makes
sending HTTP requests in C/C++ much, much easier. 

	http://curl.haxx.se/

	So now that you have the two dependencies for this plugin getting the
sucker to actually compile is very simple. I am going to segement the 
instructions below for all the different systems as I am able to get a 
successful build working on the platform/compiler vendor in question.

(1) Linux

 a. Drop the bitly.c file into the pidgin/libpurple/plugins directory.
 b. make bitly.c LDFLAGS+='curl-config --libs'
 c. cp bitly.so ~/.purple/plugins
